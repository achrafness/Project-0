## Challenge script

In this competition, participants are tasked with predicting the temperatures for the year 2022 using historical climate data spanning from 1970 to 2021. Utilizing daily temperature readings as well as advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, competitors aim to forecast future temperature trends with a focus on mitigating the risks associated with climate change. The primary evaluation metric for this competition is the coefficient of determination (R-squared), which measures the models ability to explain the variance in the observed temperature data. Participants will employ various modeling approaches, including climate models, trend analyses, time series forecasting, and machine learning algorithms, to generate accurate predictions. By leveraging the wealth of historical climate data and employing sophisticated modeling techniques, participants strive to provide valuable insights into future temperature patterns, aiding in proactive climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.
